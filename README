This application reads data from Zappos restaurant API and for a given budget amount entered by the customer
it suggests the best combination of items he/she can but each day from a given date till the date for which
menu has been decided.

I have left the option open to enter a custom date. Ideally the application should only suggest combination
of items for the current date and all dates after current date till the day for which menu has been decided.

Program asks for a date to be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Command Line arguments: args[0] is your budget, all arguments after this are list of restricted items you don't want to buy

You can choose to either give command line arguments or choose not to
in which case budget is assumed to be 0.0 and no items are assumed to be
excluded.
Also, one can give as may items to exclude as possible( given that
those items are present).
On being successfully run, the applications displays the combination of
items one can buy today and on future dates as per the given information in
the JSON data contained in the provided URL.
